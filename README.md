Create an application that finds tweets using the keyword (for example - ‘covid19’), stores raw data in log files, cleanses the raw data and
performs certain text analysis.

The problem is divided in 3 stages with individual scores for each stage. For an entry to be eligible for the evaluation it has to at least provide
solution to Stage 1.

    Stage 1 - Find recent tweets using the keyword and store the raw data in log files.
    Stage 2 - Process and clean the raw data and save the processed data in log files
    Stage 3 - Perform following tasks on processed data
                Problem A - Generate word cloud
                Problem B - Create inverted index for hashtags, mentions and words appearing in the tweets
                Problem C - Perform Sentiment Analysis and publish distribution by place
